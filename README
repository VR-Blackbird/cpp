This repo contains some c++ code.

Variable Storage durations in C++:
    Static storage - variable dies when the program exits.
    local storage - variables declared within a block will die once the execution comes out of the block (Variable lives within that block).
    Dynamic storage - We decide on when the variable dies.

Variable Scope in C++:
Defines where we can access a variable
